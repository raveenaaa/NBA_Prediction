# nba-prediction

This project deals with predicting game outcomes of the 2004-05 NBA season.
The season matches(season.csv) are used to train different models and the playoff matches(playoffs.csv) are used as the test set. 
Different methods are used for the prediction - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree and AdaBoost classifier. 

The data is pre-processed and the different models are trained and tested.
Their prediction accuracies are compared and optimal training parameters are found.
The code for the above can be found in the python notebook nba.ipynb
