# nba-prediction

This project deals with predicting game outcomes of the 2004-05 NBA season. 
<br/>
The season matches(season.csv) are used to train different models and the playoff matches(playoffs.csv) are used as the test set.

<br/>
Different methods are used for the prediction - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree and AdaBoost classifier. 
<br/>
The data is pre-processed and the different models are trained and tested. 
<br/>
Their prediction accuracies are compared and optimal training parameters are found. 
<br/>
The code for the above can be found in the python notebook nba.ipynb <br/>
